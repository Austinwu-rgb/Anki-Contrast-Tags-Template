# Anki-Contrast-Tags-Template
Two custom card templates (Basic and Cloze deletion) for Anki, AnkiMobile and Ankidroid. Added functionality: display tags on flashcards. Customized using Python, CSS and HTML. The apkg file can be run to import the templates instantly. 

## !Disclaimer 
The Python code I used is not entirely original, and has been only modified for additional functionality under license.
