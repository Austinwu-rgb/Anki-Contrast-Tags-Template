# Anki-Contrast-Tags-Template
Two custom card templates (Basic and Cloze deletion) for Anki, AnkiMobile and Ankidroid. Added functionality: display tags on flashcards. Customized using Python, CSS and HTML. It is recommended to run the apkg template file rather than to drag the indidual files into their respective folders. 

##Disclaimer: 
The Python code I used is not entirely original, and has been only modified for additional functionality under license.
